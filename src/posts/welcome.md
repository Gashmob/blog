## [Introduction](#introduction)

Hi! My name is Kevin Traini and you currently are on my blog. I will not present myself extensively, if you want more
information you can find everything on [my portfolio](https://ktraini.com). So to be short, I'm a developer and in my
spare time I work on several side projects.

And now here comes this blog (a new side project). Its goal is to document my other projects, how I work on it and the
all reflexion behind. Also, I want to share some tricks and tips I discover along. You will not see any post on previous
projects as I don't have many thing to share about, but there may be some tips from them if I remember them.

## [Some foretaste](#some-foretaste)

I already planned to write a few posts in the near future. Some may not interest you as they are basic knowledge in
software engineering. But my next side project can be interesting if you are interested in grammar (I will not tell
more here).

## [Thank you](#thank-you)

Already at the conclusion. This post is not massive as it is just an introduction to this blog. But I want to thank you
to be here and take the time to read those lines.

If you may have questions, feel free to contact me on LinkedIn, GitHub, elsewhere...

As a final word, I'll just say: _may the code be with you_.
