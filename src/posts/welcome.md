Hi! My name is Kevin Traini and you currently are on my blog. I'm a developer and in my spare time I work on several
side project. I will not present myself extensively, this is not the scope of this post, if you want more information
you can find everything on [my portfolio](https://ktraini.com).

And now here comes this blog (a new side project). Its goal is to document my other projects, how I work on them and all
the reflexion behind. Also, I want to share some tricks and tips I discover along that can be applied to any projects.

I already planned a few posts in the near future. Some may not interest you as they are basic knowledge in software
engineering. But my next side project can be interesting if you are interested in grammar (I will not tell more here).

Already the conclusion. This post is not massive as it is just an introduction to this blog. But I want to thank you to
be here and take the time to read those lines.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

As a final word, I'll just say: _may the code be with you_.
